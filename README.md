## Guide
```
***NOTE: 
1. This project doesn't contain any third-party library or plugin, just vanilla JavaScript on Vue.js framework.
2. I've use neu morphism UI concept to make the design much more 2020.
3. Overall user-experience is improved by reducing user engagement with trigger and controllers by making realtime.
4. User can direct to particular detailed page clicking table values and download details as an json file.
You do not need any submit button apply these searchs and filters.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
There are 3 search type at the moment,
by "organizations", "users" and "tickets".
You can search by any column value related to the selected collection,
example: "name", "url", "subject", "description", "tags", "via", etc...
also able to enable filter under particular serach type.
If you selected "Users" search type, there will be 4 filter to enable.
